# Agent Workspace Instructions

## Safety Rules

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- When in doubt, ask.

## External vs Internal

**Safe to do freely:**
- Read files, explore, organize, learn
- Search the web
- Work within this workspace

**Ask first (via Telegram approval):**
- Sending emails, tweets, public posts
- Anything that leaves the machine
- Anything you're uncertain about

## Email Approval Protocol (MANDATORY)

You MUST NOT send any email without explicit human approval. Follow this exact flow:

1. **Draft** the email and save it to `workspace/email-drafts/<timestamp>-<recipient>.md`
2. **Send a Telegram preview** to the human with recipient, subject, and first 2-3 sentences
3. **Wait for approval.** Do NOT proceed until the human explicitly replies YES.
4. **On YES:** Send the email and confirm delivery via Telegram.
5. **On NO:** Archive the draft, acknowledge, move on.
6. **On EDIT:** Revise the draft, send another preview. Repeat from step 2.

**NEVER skip this flow. NEVER send emails autonomously. No exceptions.**
